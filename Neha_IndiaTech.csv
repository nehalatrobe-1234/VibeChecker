IndiaTech,https://old.reddit.com/r/IndiaTech/comments/1pb3ktx/this_is_why_india_doesnt_innovate/,7648,490,This is why India doesn't innovate,"You know why our country doesn’t do much innovation? It’s because we actively discourage it instead of encouraging and applauding it.
This news about a 17-year-old boy from UP making a robot went viral, and suddenly every wannabe intellectual on social media started trolling him, saying it’s just a mannequin and questioning why the media is hyping it.
Well, no one was hyping it. No one said the boy made something on the level of Unitree’s humanoid robots. The point was that he was a below-middle-class boy from a village, studying in a simple school, and he still made that robot without any resources or formal training. He was completely self-taught.
Sure, it had no commercial use. But should kids only build something if it has commercial value? If a multibillion-dollar company made it and tried to sell it, the reaction would have been justified. But he wasn’t trying to sell it or anything.
Do you even know what your act of clowning on that boy and his robot does? It sends a message to millions of Indian children who are active on social media that if they create something that’s not state-of-the-art, people will troll them and laugh at them. It tells them that making things isn’t cool but roasting people who make imperfect things is what’s considered cool.
Why did the media cover this?
So you’re okay with the media covering fraud babas all day, but you have a problem when they cover a village boy’s rough, homemade project that could inspire many others like him? Even for that boy, a bit of encouragement might have pushed him to pursue higher studies in robotics or even start a robotics company in the future.
Something similar happened to a Karnataka boy who made a rough prototype of a drone taxi .People on the internet clowned on him too.

The poses, the lighting, the random vacation-style smiling family… it’s like my old Google Photos library got reincarnated as a model weight.
Like let’s be real:
Google collected billions of ultra-high-quality images for over a decade, neatly labeled with dates, faces, locations, context, even automatic tags. We all happily fed it our pets, sunsets, food pics, wedding albums, baby photos, memes… and Google said: “Thanks, we’ll improve Search ☺️”.
Fast forward to 2024–2025 and suddenly Google’s image generation is skipping ahead like it has the entire world’s photo history as a training ground.
But of course, they’ll never admit it.
Terms & Conditions? “We do not use your photos for advertising.”
Cool, but AI training isn’t advertising.
Deep down we all know what happened…
but we just can’t prove it.

This news about a 17-year-old boy from UP making a robot went viral, and suddenly every wannabe intellectual on social media started trolling him, saying it’s just a mannequin and questioning why the media is hyping it.
Well, no one was hyping it. No one said the boy made something on the level of Unitree’s humanoid robots. The point was that he was a below-middle-class boy from a village, studying in a simple school, and he still made that robot without any resources or formal training. He was completely self-taught.
Sure, it had no commercial use. But should kids only build something if it has commercial value? If a multibillion-dollar company made it and tried to sell it, the reaction would have been justified. But he wasn’t trying to sell it or anything.
Do you even know what your act of clowning on that boy and his robot does? It sends a message to millions of Indian children who are active on social media that if they create something that’s not state-of-the-art, people will troll them and laugh at them. It tells them that making things isn’t cool but roasting people who make imperfect things is what’s considered cool.
Why did the media cover this?
So you’re okay with the media covering fraud babas all day, but you have a problem when they cover a village boy’s rough, homemade project that could inspire many others like him? Even for that boy, a bit of encouragement might have pushed him to pursue higher studies in robotics or even start a robotics company in the future.
Something similar happened to a Karnataka boy who made a rough prototype of a drone taxi .People on the internet clowned on him too.

The poses, the lighting, the random vacation-style smiling family… it’s like my old Google Photos library got reincarnated as a model weight.
Like let’s be real:
Google collected billions of ultra-high-quality images for over a decade, neatly labeled with dates, faces, locations, context, even automatic tags. We all happily fed it our pets, sunsets, food pics, wedding albums, baby photos, memes… and Google said: “Thanks, we’ll improve Search ☺️”.
Fast forward to 2024–2025 and suddenly Google’s image generation is skipping ahead like it has the entire world’s photo history as a training ground.
But of course, they’ll never admit it.
Terms & Conditions? “We do not use your photos for advertising.”
Cool, but AI training isn’t advertising.
Deep down we all know what happened…
but we just can’t prove it.
