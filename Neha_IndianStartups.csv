Laddu Tabrez
first refused to leave my iMac with security on a Saturday, then returned on a weekday, heckled my entire team while we were on deadline, and refused to deliver the device. When I confronted him, he told me harshly to ""forget about it.""
My team's on a tight deadline and desperately needed a new iMac, which Amazon has now failed to deliver twice because of the truly bizarre and hostile actions of one delivery guy. The first attempt was last Saturday. I wasn't in the office, but we have security staff available for package acceptance. This guy flat out refused to leave the high-value item with them, creating a large, unnecessary disturbance with his unprofessional loudness before marking the item as ""undeliverable."" This initial refusal immediately put me behind schedule and forced me to re-order the critical equipment.
I quickly placed the second order, hoping to salvage my week, only to be horrified when the exact same guy showed up. He immediately started his routine again, making a huge ruckus being loud, harassing, and generally disruptive. His actions took unnecessary liberty, severely disturbing both my entire team, who were on a tight deadline, and the office staff too. I had to stop working and personally confront him about the delivery, explaining the urgency and the fact that this was the second attempt caused by his previous non-delivery.
His response was simply shocking. He maintained a harsh, and utterly unprofessional tone and told me directly to ""forget about it"" ""Bhool jao, nahi milega"". He then refused to hand over the iMac and promptly left. I'm now facing serious delays in my business operations and team productivity, all due to the targeted malice and staggering unprofessionalism of one delivery agent. I’ve reported this to Amazon, but the idea of re-ordering a third time with the risk of him showing up again is stressing me out. Does anyone have advice on how to force Amazon to handle this targeted harassment and finally get my essential equipment?
EDIT: Left out a crucial detail, the order was marked ""Returned"" and I had not idea when/ how this happened because I never refused delivery. All this violence BS happened when I called the delivery agent's number from the Amazon-order tracking portal, and the guy who came was apparently his brother or whatever. This guy has never even stepped foot near my office to deliver the thing. And we've filed a police complaint against this miscreant. Hoping for justice soon.",https://i.redd.it/yhzfd960kj7g1.png

China, more populated than India, is beating US when it comes to technology, and they are still following 9-9-6 work culture. Forget about comparison, India is nowhere in that league.
As for India, all we have is, a saree wearing mannequin with a speaker made by 12th grade student, countless ""revolutionary"" chatGPT wrappers, 20 quick commerce players (and more in pipeline) making loss each year, and now a population that wants to be fed for doing nothing. Fantastic!

And when he started an experiment with lemon cultivation in the land of wheat and rice people were even more surprised.
In an exclusive interview with Startup Pedia, Mishra shared his journey from being a usual serviceman to becoming the ‘Lemon Man’ of Uttar Pradesh.
Initially, he cultivated the two staple crops, wheat and paddy but soon realized why farmers were unhappy. One hectare of field yielded an annual profit of only ₹ 52,000.
Meeting officials at the District Agriculture Office one fine morning suddenly brought him the idea of lemon cultivation. However, he was clueless at the start as no one could give him the information he needed as before him no one tried cultivating lemons.
Gradually, he started reaping the fruits of his labor. His lemon production flourished and money started pouring in. People in Raebareli as well as throughout Uttar Pradesh fondly started calling him the ‘Lemon Man.’
Today, Lemon Man Anand Mishra is not just a farmer. With an annual turnover of fifteen lakhs, he is a horticulture expert, trainer, and corporate consultant.
When asked if this horticulture business is profitable, Lemon Man confidently replied it sure is. “For lemon cultivation, a farmer can make 2 - 5 Lakhs from 1 acre of land from the 4th year while for traditional it would be only 30-35K annually.”
On asking about the biggest challenge one faces while cultivating lemons, Mishra revealed it was the unavailability of insurance. “Horticulture has no insurance although we are taking huge risks,” Lemon Man laments.
Anand Mishra is confident that anyone can do lemon cultivation.
You can allot a small area for horticulture even while doing a full-time job. It will generate extra income and who does not need some extra money?",https://i.redd.it/dfgceyra75wd1.jpeg

• If your boss asks you to work even a minute past those 8 hours, they legally have to pay you at least double your regular salary for that overtime.
It's a ""Private Member's"" Bill: This is the problem. It means it was introduced by an individual MP, not by the ruling government.Pvt Member Bills are essentially non-priority items.It's tough for them even to get debated properly.

It's been 14 months and the vision is great but due to internal issues, we are shutting it down. 
Here are my learnings that I hope will help group members here. 
1. Pick your cofounders like you pick your spouse
2. Unresolved conflicts will kill the startup faster than competition 
3. Leadership isn't about titles but it's about action
4. Don't let one person hijack the company direction. Doesn't matter how senior he is
5. Be wary if your cofounder overstates or misleads investors
6. Never rely on verbal agreements 
7. Ensure legal and financial transparency from day one
8. Don't ignore red flags in your co founders. You may think you can work around it but don't even try 
9. Keep a clear paper trail. 
10. Don't work with anyone who lacks integrity.
It's been hard shutting it down after so much of blood and sweat but I have to accept the reality of the situation.

Their journey began when Praveen, while pursuing his MTech, read about indoor saffron farming. After training in Thailand and visiting Pampore, Kashmir, they decided to cultivate saffron at home.
In 2018, they converted an unused room on their roof for this purpose, using aeroponics—a method that allows plants to grow in air or mist without soil.
They invested around ₹6 lakh to set up the lab, purchasing saffron bulbs from Kashmir. Despite initial setbacks with damaged seeds, they persevered and successfully harvested 2 kg of saffron in one season, earning ₹10 lakh.
The brothers carefully manage the growing conditions with temperature control, humidity, and grow lights.
They plant saffron bulbs in August and harvest the flowers in November. After harvesting, they can use the bulbs again for future planting, reducing costs significantly.
Their brand, Amaratva, not only caters to the domestic market but also exports to countries like the US and UK. By diversifying their farming with mushrooms during off-seasons, they continue to increase their earnings.",https://i.redd.it/u77zzbfibhwd1.jpeg

At first, I was just sitting on the first floor.
He walked in and said:
“Bro, this is too cramped. Let’s go to the top floor, it’s more comfortable.”
So we went upstairs, ordered food, and started talking.
He was breaking down how VCs think, how to pitch, why storytelling matters, how clarity in your head has to translate into clarity in your pitch.
Honestly, I was just soaking it all in.
While he was talking, I noticed a group of people walk into the private room right in front of us.
From the corner of my eye, I realised:
“F***. That’s Nikhil Kamath sitting there.”
I didn’t want to interrupt because his advice was gold.
But the moment he paused, he also noticed:
“Bro, Nikhil Kamath is sitting there!”
We were both starstruck.
Then he asked me:
“Do you have any business material on you?”
Me: “No card, nothing.”
Then I remembered: “Wait, I have my diary.”
He didn’t even think twice:
“Do it right now. You have to take all the chances you get.”
So I pulled out my diary, scribbled a quick handwritten note about what I’m building (BeHooked), tore the page, and folded it neatly.
We were lucky our table was right in front of the door to that room. Otherwise, this moment would never have happened.
I didn’t want to interrupt his group, so I asked the waiter to pass it along. The staff was super nice, they delivered it to him.
And then Nikhil read it carefully. He looked up, smiled, and waved at me.
That 2-second wave made the entire day worth it.
If we hadn’t moved to the top floor, none of this would have happened.
Take your shots. You never know which one will land.
I really think this could turn into something. Let’s hope for the best.

If India was as strong as China militarily, economically Pakistan wouldn't even have dared to pull off a terror attack. USA wouldn't have the power to pressure India into a ceasefire. India could have choked Pakistan without firing a shot. Also, our ministers and spokespersons would not have the necessity to go on to international media to gain advantage over Pakistan in information battle. Forget setting international narratives right, our own people were getting information from twitter, reddit, YouTube and whatnot (none of them Indian) the government had to go and reach out to the platforms to block certain content and accounts from spreading misinformation. India definitely needs a social platform, if not international at least national, like Chinese. It's a shame that our local city governing bodies had to buy twitter premium and issues alerts and pass on info to its own citizens through these networks, where do you think USA gets its intelligence for its agencies from? (facebook, instagram, x, google, apple, android, windows, etc etc)
Despite all the work in diplomacy by our foreign minister from the past decade, we had no real powers rallying behind us for justice against terrorism, no sanctions or any serious repercussions against Pakistan (the IMF loan in the middle was a serious blow), It just shows how we are left for ourselves to defend our lands, tomorrow if China comes in and tries anything in India, the world won't speak a word, they have all the rare earth metals yk.
The S400 systems that we all hail and praise, were built and tested by Russia in 1999, in 1999!!!!!, 26 years later, so many batches of IITians later and PHDs who went and researched in top tech in the west later, we have nothing remotely close to it, Even Iran has home built superior air defense systems and hypersonic missiles(used against us yesterday) despite under deep western sanctions, don't even talk about fighter jets, we just spend billions and buy whatever is available, despite knowing, export variations of the jets from any country are inferior to their own home jets. We know full well that countries can and will withhold weapons in a time of need for India. In the event of war, if Russia, USA or France for that matter decide to not sell any weapons/defense for us, we are truly f**ed.
I have huge respect for our army. 80 Billon Dollars(6 lack 80 thousand CRORE rupees!) is our Defense spending. why are there not a lot of startups building things for the Army? why does it always have to be DRDO, that does the military research? Are we not dreaming big enough? My work and company is no less important than yours and your contribution for the country, but there definitely is a lot of nobility and sense of pride when building for our nation and her security.

I mentioned to her a buddy of mine who just launched a soap startup for people with sensitive skin and I asked her, “Would you invest in something like that?”
She immediately said no, not because the product was bad or the founder wasn’t capable. Her reason was simple and it was: The product doesn’t get better with more people use it.
She explained that great startup ideas usually have some built-in compounding advantage (in terms of product feature, not cost). Something that makes the product stronger, or smarter as more people use it.
Soap doesn’t do that. You sell it, that’s it, it doesn’t improve with use or unlock new value at scale.
The problem is when founders take VC money to sell cheap and grow fast, but later investors want profits. So prices go up. Then a new startup comes in with fresh funding and undercuts them. Rinse and repeat. Especially in markets like India, where anyone can white-label a similar product and compete on price.
Her advice was clear and honest, it’s one of the simplest yet powerful mental models I’ve heard on judging startup ideas:
If your product doesn’t get better with more users, think twice before treating it like a startup. Maybe it’s just a solid business. And that’s perfectly okay.",
