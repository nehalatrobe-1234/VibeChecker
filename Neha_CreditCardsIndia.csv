Introduction
Hello everyone, I am Ravi Singh—
the real
Ravi Singh. I am a victim of
KYC impersonation
who has been battling with multiple Indian banks and NBFCs for the past year. My goal is to protect my
CIBIL score
and financial credibility from fraudulent activities perpetrated by scammers who somehow obtained my
PAN
and
Aadhaar
details.
In this post, I want to share my ordeal in detail. This story highlights the failures of several banks (KreditBee, Axis Bank, Poonawalla Fincorp, ICICI Bank, and finally HDFC) in detecting and preventing fraud. It also explains how the
RBI Ombudsman
process works, and how you can protect your rights.
There were 72+ enquiries in my CIBIL in the past 12 months but these banks proved to be the most deceptive and cunning in their practices and support.
So, grab a cup of coffee, settle in, and learn from my struggle on how to fight bank fraud and protect your financial reputation in India.
The Shocking CKYC Update (January 2024)
CKYC (Central KYC)
is a centralized repository of customer identification information. One day, I received an email stating there had been changes in my CKYC record.
When I opened the attached PDF, I was shocked: all the details except my
name
and
date of birth
belonged to a
fraudster
—including someone else’s photo, address, and phone number. Lived all my life in NCR. This picture in CKYC is of the fraudster who was able to get KreditBee loan of INR 10K.
CKYC Data reported by KreditBee, It was later Fixed by KreditBee Only After RBI Compliant
I immediately contacted the CKYC helpdesk and learned that
KreditBee
had updated my CKYC records.
KreditBee’s Role
KreditBee insisted I had taken a
10,000 INR
loan and claimed they had transferred the amount to
my Axis Bank account
(which, as I would later discover, actually belonged to the fraudster). I have only two bank accounts and none (never) in Axis bank.
This fraudulent loan also appeared in my
CIBIL report
, showing mismatched details (the fraudster’s address and phone number, but my name and DOB).
KreditBee
refused
to remove it from my CIBIL despite me sending them KYC documents, my
cybercrime FIR
, my CIBIL report, and more.
Taking It to the RBI Ombudsman
In desperation, I lodged a complaint with the
RBI Ombudsman
against KreditBee, attaching all relevant documents.
After a lengthy back-and-forth (including video KYC verification to prove I was the real Ravi Singh), KreditBee finally agreed (around
March 2024
) to rectify and remove the loan from my CIBIL report.
KreditBee Accepted their Flaw and Rectified the CIBIL
KreditBee corrected my Details in CKYC As Well
Axis Bank’s Massive Breach (February–March 2024)
While I was still dealing with KreditBee,
another nightmare
unfolded:
I tried to use my Axis Bank credit card on Flipkart but never received any OTPs. I also didn’t get my February statement.
When I logged into the Axis Bank app, I discovered that
all my contact details
—phone numbers, email addresses, even my residential and work details—were replaced with the
fraudster’s
information.
Check the address, not mine, but of fraudster that matches CKYC data reported by KreditBee
This led me to realize that
the fraudster
was getting my OTPs and sensitive statements. This huge data breach allowed the scammer to potentially apply for more loans and credit cards in my name.
Around the same time, I noticed fresh
CIBIL inquiries
from Axis Bank.
Struggle with Axis Bank Support
Because my phone number was changed in Axis’s system, I couldn’t even authenticate myself as a customer.
Address reported by Axis Bank - the bank rejected the Dispute on CIBIL right away. And this was reported to CIBIL when my complaint was with PNO
Axis Bank Denying Rectifications and tried to deceive me and did their best to fool me. But I had learned from previous experience that only banks and NBFCs can correct these or rectify these even when they keep in denial mode.
After much effort, I found and emailed the
Principal Nodal Officer (PNO)
. Their replies were mostly
copy-paste
responses saying they were “working on it.” And their excuse was ""The name, PAN, and DoB"" used for fraudulant Card Application/loan matched mine in their system and so they changed my Address, Phone Number, Email. And they never informed me via call, SMS, or email about this change.
Axis Bank's One of the Initial Response after RBI Complaint
Eventually, I canceled my Axis Bank card to avoid further risk. Their official stance was that they had “no relationship” with me besides the canceled card and closed my service request without addressing the breach.
Second RBI Ombudsman Complaint
On
April 2, 2024
, I lodged another complaint with the RBI Ombudsman—this time against Axis Bank.
Axis Bank kept
denying
wrongdoing and repeatedly stated the same response to both me and the RBI.
It took
9 months
for them to finally rectify my CIBIL data in December 2024, a process they had previously claimed was impossible. I wrote literally 100 emails that took me several hours.
https://preview.redd.it/sqmongc4cade1.png?width=1894&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fcf70fd279496a3981988626d6872dd9f550e7b
Eventually, they
paid compensation
(I demanded more, given the magnitude of the breach and the stress caused), but my complaint with the RBI Ombudsman remained open for nearly
10 months
. Received partial compensation, waiting for the remaining, if RBI deems it valid.
A Wave of Fresh Loan Inquiries
From February 2024 onward, I continued to see
new loan inquiries
popping up occasionally in my CIBIL report. It seemed that the same fraudsters kept trying to open new accounts or apply for loans using my PAN. When I contacted various banks or NBFCs, most of them were cooperative and quickly fixed the errors—
except a few
.
Poonawalla Fincorp (April 2024)
April 2024
: I discovered a new
2.8 Lakh INR
loan from Poonawalla Fincorp in my CIBIL report.
They
ignored
my initial emails, and their PNO didn’t respond. When I called, he denied any conversation and threatened
police and court action
if I “shouted” at him.
Grievance officer for Delhi on 9876543498 – Gurmeet Singh
- This information is Public on Poonawalla website from where found it! He said this is my Personal number.
Public Info - Grievance office who Threatened me for FIR and Legal Threat
Personal loan account number reflecting in my CIBIL for INR 2.8Lakhs
I lodged a complaint with the RBI Ombudsman again.
Finally, a
supportive
representative from Poonawalla reached out, took my documents (Cybercrime FIR, KYC, etc.), and eventually
rectified
my CIBIL.
Cybercrime report. the IO did nothing and disposed of this with no comments. He never connected with me and when i called, didn't pick. Complaint to senior and commissioner also was of no use.
I did
not
demand compensation here because they were already hit financially by their own failure to identify the fraudster.
These details reported by Poonawalla are the same reported by Axis Bank, KreditBee - Scammer/fraudster is still using these details.

ICICI Bank (August 2024)
I’ve been an ICICI Bank customer since around
2014–15
, holding a savings account and a credit card.
On
June 9, 2024
, I received a CIBIL alert that
ICICI Bank
had made a credit card inquiry in my name.
https://preview.redd.it/4js437s7iade1.png?width=1120&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4e737973be7ef7ec24fa397f2ae52950508e1b7
I contacted them immediately, including my Relationship Manager (RM), but she was
unhelpful
, despite knowing about ongoing fraud on my PAN.
They denied. And this is when I am their existing customer with a card that has a really good limit - no help from the Grievance team, My so-called \""dedicated\"" relationship manager
Soon after, I got an SMS saying a
new credit card
(Adani card with a 5 Lakh INR limit) had been
dispatched
to scammer's same Jayanagar address. Understand the gravity here, they literally dispatched it to the address provided by the scammer while I am in their system for past 10 years and no change in my address when I am checking iMobile app or statements.
I insisted they cancel the card immediately. Though they canceled it, they
refused to rectify
my CIBIL record, claiming
I
had applied for the card.
Then I got two new enquiry again from ICICI while my complaint was with them in July 202
RBI Ombudsman—Again
Another
RBI Ombudsman
complaint forced ICICI Bank’s compliance team to investigate. And this is what they had top say initially which triggered a series of investigation by RBI.
They literally delivered the credit card issued to the scammer's address as shared in the response to the RBI complaint. At this stage, they did not realize what blunder they had made and thought that they were fine and it's the customer who was at fault - clearly not.
After about
two months
, they finally removed the fraudulent card entry from my CIBIL. I demanded compensation, pointing out the RM’s negligence. their PNO Rashmi was very supportive and dealt with my complaint very well - Thanks to RBI.
https://preview.redd.it/gyzshnzqjade1.png?width=2744&format=png&auto=webp&s=da3f8a1ea840aa061cbec028a0def60d38e86bc0
While the bank remains prone to such fraudulent inquiries, at least I now have a direct line to a
supportive PNO
.
HDFC Bank: The Most Cunning & Deceptive (April–December 2024)
Finally, we arrive at
HDFC Bank
, which has been the trickiest to deal with.
April 2024
: HDFC reported
two credit card inquiries
in my CIBIL.
You can See the HDFC April Enquiry here. And Axis bank still didn't stop from putting more enquiries.
I sent all proof (cybercrime FIR, KYC, etc.) but was
initially ignored
or told that I had applied for the card
After 30 days of no resolution, I lodged a complaint with the
RBI Ombudsman
.
HDFC’s False “Resolution”
HDFC eventually responded that they would do me a “
favor
” and rectify the inquiry, offering a 2,000 INR gift card
Look this was their resolution that I opposed after which they provided mixed logs of a genuine enquiry done in Novemebr 2023 - the complaint was never about this enquiry and the fraudulant one done in April 2024 - againt which I complaint with them and RBI.
I was offended by their tone, as if they were doing me a
personal favor
rather than fixing their own KYC failure.
I asked for an
apology
and demanded 10K INR compensation (willing to settle for 5K). This may have triggered them to not avoid paying me because if the accept their fault, they will have to pay. So they decided not to and presented misleading facts, fooling RBI Ombudsman beacuse I thing RBI deems the practice by HDFC valid which require no authentication from rightful owner of the PAN before fetching their damn reports. More about this below.
RBI Ombudsman’s Closure—on the Wrong Data
In
November 2024
, RBI Ombudsman
closed
the complaint, stating “no deficiency found” at HDFC’s end.
The
PNO, Mr. Ripal Seth
, had apparently
mixed
logs from a genuine inquiry I had made in
November 2023
with the fraudulent inquiry of
April 2024
, misleading the RBI into believing everything was legitimate.
https://preview.redd.it/irngvh1jmade1.png?width=2784&format=png&auto=webp&s=761a148462ea31022e9bbccef8aa1f05e5942700
Because this was an RBI final decision, my only recourse was going to court.
New HDFC Fraud in December 2024
On
December 2, 2024
, HDFC again reported
two more card inquiries
on my CIBIL.
I emailed the PNO (the same trail with RBI) and got no response for over a month.
On
January 13, 2025
, I filed a
new
RBI Ombudsman complaint, detailing how HDFC had
deceived
the RBI previously.
HDFC’s Fraud-Friendly Application System
Curious about how these inquiries keep happening, I decided to test HDFC’s
online credit card application
process:
All you need is someone’s PAN.
Enter any phone number
(not necessarily linked to that PAN).
HDFC
pulls
the CIBIL report for that PAN,
regardless
of whether the phone number or address matches the actual PAN holder.
If the PAN is found “eligible,” it can proceed to an “OTP verification” that might be tied to the
fake phone number
.
Here's the complete video. Please watch :
https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1i13lfx/how_hdfc_bank_enabling_fraudsters_to_exploit_pan/
This means
anyone
with your PAN can damage your CIBIL score, even if they don’t have your Aadhaar or other documents.
HDFC
doesn’t properly verify identity before pulling your CIBIL, so the
fraudster
effectively has a free pass to ruin your credit history.
When confronted,
HDFC
claims that “OTP verification” is enough proof of identity—and even the
RBI
has accepted this logic when presented with distorted facts. Meanwhile, innocent customers like me keep getting their CIBIL scores dented.
Why I am Sharing This
This took me 5-6 hours to prepare and structure my story and several hours and mental peace that I lost over last 12 month just beacuse Indian banks failing to validate or identify a simple fact which is their duty, i.e., ""to ensure that the person or applicat is really is who he/she claims to be."" Especially in todays digital age and in India where data privacy and protection are non-existent. There are no laws or regulations as such that a citizen can use even if he/she wants to pursue it legally.
I’m sharing this story to
warn the public
:
Monitor your CIBIL
regularly.
Stay alert
for unauthorized inquiries or accounts.
Keep an eye on your CKYC data
. Any change, immediately take clarification from CKYC who updated this and reach out to them for correction.
Lock your Aadhar Biometrics
to avoid any loan processing in your name and PAN. Enquiries won't stop with this but loans processing will.
Act quickly
with both the bank and the RBI Ombudsman if you spot fraud.
Don’t lose hope.
If you are honest and persistent, you will eventually get your record fixed.
These experiences show that
some Indian banks
—especially HDFC—are enabling fraudsters by having
poor KYC verification
procedures. When victims speak up, they often face denial, obfuscation, or blame-shifting as I showed in this post with all proofs. I have many more proofs but there is a limit of 20 images in a post on Reddit.
Even the RBI Ombudsman process can be misled if banks present
false or incomplete
data. There seems to be no checks!
Please share this post
, talk about it on social media, and
tag
the right people or authorities who can amplify the issue. We need proper checks and accountability in the banking system to ensure no one else goes through this mental stress, harassment, and potential financial ruin.
Thank you for reading.

You should get a 100% refund (almost)!,"Context - had booked a domestic return ticket earlier today through HDFC SmartBuy using a mix of points and card. A change in plan occurred shortly after and had to cancel the return leg. First time cancelling a flight ticket - quickly looked up any rules around cancellations within 24 hours and DGCA charter is very explicit - you get full refund barring convenience fee charged by the airline / aggregator if you meet two conditions -
Cancellation initiated with 24 hours
Travel date is more than 7 days away
DGCA sources for future reference if you need to quote.
Source 1 (section 3.e)
/
Source 2 (PDF page 8)
What to expect when you call for cancellation?
My experience -
Tried cancelling through the website on phone - the cancellation charges reflected as blank
Checked through laptop - showed I will get back INR 1,589 against a paid amount of 5,519 (71% loss)
Finally called up Yatra support (they don't make it easy at all to get their customer care number) - the executive put me on hold for 10 mins to figure my cancellation charges and later told me the same charges as in the screenshot - I will only get INR 1,589.
Magic words - all I had to say was - given my booking is less than 24 hours old, per DGCA I should get a full refund barring few charges, no? Immediately without a moment's break he responds 'yes, sir
in that case since this is a ""DGCA booking"" (whatever that means) only INR 320 convenience charge won't be refunded. THEY RELY ON YOUR LACK OF KNOWLEDGE TO MAKE MONEY. I will now be getting a refund of INR 5,199 (instead of INR 1,589) by just saying this one magical line. I tried to grill him on why did he even give me the lower refund amount - gave me BS that beat around the bush. Knowledge is power, truly.
Hence I thought to make this post in this group where people book a lot of flights using cc. Don't let the crooks at Yatra take you for a ride (pun intended).
Bonus - confirmed with HDFC Concierge - my points and card payment will be returned in the same format + got to know even the HDFC concierge can help with cancellation requests (the booking email mentioned contact OTA so didn't realise).",https://i.redd.it/byo5rz8i646f1.png

My friend was one night scrolling X (Formerly Twitter) where one OnlyF*ns(OF) model shared in a tweet that for tonight she is making her annual subscription free for 1 day. My friend went on the website to sign up and saw that it requires a credit card for creating the subscription which charges 0$. He went in and put his Credit Card details and brought the subscription.
Everything was going smooth and he got the invoice of 0$ being charged in his credit statement. In the next few minutes He got a call from his bank, There was a girl speaking and she asked ""Sir, We found some suspicious activity on your card, Wanted to confirm have you made any international payment to merchant OnlyF
ns ??"" 
My friend fumbled and straight away denied that the transaction wasn't his. Since he thought if he committed that he brought a OnlyF
ns Subscription, The girl on the phone will think he is some kind of pervert and he will feel embrassed.
The girl then said that she is cancelling the credit card citing the reason ""Unauthorised Transaction"" and you will not be able to use the card. You have to re apply for a new card. To which my friend accepted as he have no choice.
In the end my friend justified all this by saying
""Credit card dub jaaye beshak, Izzat nhi dubni chahiye"" (Meaning reputation is more important than a credit card)",
CreditCardsIndia,https://old.reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1kwfh1m/xuv700_bought_using_axis_atlas/,1835,187,XUV700 Bought using Axis Atlas,"Hey everyone,
I recently made a significant purchase – a new car – and I wanted to detail how my Axis Atlas credit card (which is Lifetime Free, by the way – no joining or annual fees!) played a crucial role in maximizing my rewards. It was a bit of a strategic move to optimize my benefits, and I think it paid off handsomely!
I made two significant payments for my new car.
For each transaction, there was a convenience fee applied, which is standard for large payments like this via credit card. Let's break down how much that cost me versus the points I earned:
Transaction 1 (Initial Payment): ₹375,550 (including a 1.5% charge). The fee component here was ₹5,550.
Transaction 2 (Remaining Balance): ₹343,799 (including a 2% charge). The fee component here was ₹6,741.16.
Total Extra Fees Paid: ₹12,291.16
Now, for the exciting part – the points!
 * From the first transaction, I received 7,510 Edge Miles.
 * This payment pushed my spending past ₹3 Lakh, bagging me an extra 2,500 Edge Miles instantly!
 * The second transaction yielded 6,874 Edge Miles.
 * Crucially, this payment, combined with some of my travel-related spending throughout the year, helped me achieve the ₹7.5 Lakh spend milestone, earning me another 2,500 Edge Miles!
Total Edge Miles Earned: 19,384 Edge Miles!
The real magic of the Axis Atlas card lies in its conversion rates. Here's how my Edge Miles translate into valuable Accor points and then into actual rupees:
 * Edge Miles to Accor Points: With 1 Edge Mile converting to 2 Accor Points, my 19,384 Edge Miles become a whopping 38,768 Accor Points!
 * Accor Points Value: Knowing that 1 Accor Point is valued at ₹1.9, the total value of my points is a significant ₹73,659.2!
After accounting for the fees I paid, the net value I achieved from using my Axis Atlas card for the car purchase is truly impressive:
 * Value of Points: ₹73,659.2
 * Less Total Fees Paid: ₹12,291.16
 * Net Value Achieved: ₹61,368.04!
To put this into perspective, let's look at the overall return. The total amount I spent on the card (including the fees) for the car was ₹719,349.
This means I effectively received a return of approximately 8.53% in the form of valuable Accor points, even after deducting the fees!",

This is not exactly news, but I am posting this here for the first time.
I worked in BOI and get my first Credit Card several years back.
(Read more about that here :
https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1cw9qso/
)
But now holding several good cards I no longer needed a BOI Credit Card.
So, I wrote an application to close it. And wrote a couple of more applications (There was no online method for this). More than an year passed and nothing happened.
Then came this new RBI Circular regarding Credit Cards which dictates new rules regarding various aspects of Credit Cards.
Specifically :
Penalty of Rs500/day if Bank fail to close a Credit Card within 7 days of request.
So, I wrote another application and kept the receipt, waited for a mandatory 30 days and escalated my complaint to RBI.
After 56 days (total), the bank decided to close my credit card and pay me Rs 28000 as compensation as per the circular.",

Unfortunately, they rejected me twice before birth apparently, ""fetal stage"" isn’t a valid KYC status.
Once I was born, I had a serious discussion with my RM. He suggested I drop ₹15 lakh into a ULIP for the card. I politely declined why should I gamble my milk money on market fluctuations? Instead, I escalated the matter to grievances, making my case:
I’d be the youngest Infinia holder ever.
I’d already spent ₹9 lakh in six months on diapers alone.
My toy budget for the next few years was looking like Ambani’s Diwali expenses.
Grievances took one look at my projected burn rate and caved, granting me the Infinia. But just as I got comfortable, HDFC pulled a fast one and launched the Infinia Reserve.
What followed was two years of absolute shit show, tripling my diaper budget just to meet the Reserve's minimum spend. I was burning cash faster than a tech startup. But after relentless swiping, I finally did it. HDFC bowed down and handed me the Reserve.
And that, my friends, is how I went from prenatal rejection to Reserve domination before even learning how to walk. AMA.",https://i.redd.it/hx5022w8zyme1.jpeg

[Please Read this before posting anything HDFC],"It's no surprise, HDFC is one of the biggest banks in India, if not the biggest. And every day, more and more people are either applying for HDFC Cards, or getting pre-approved offers as they have Salaried account, and we are getting REPEATED posts about the same topics, that makes it kind of difficult to get the right answers for newcomers.
Here's a complete guide, so please read this before posting anything.
Core vs Co-brand cards
The Core cards from HDFC are-
- Freedom
- Moneyback/+
- Millenia / DinersClub Millenia
- DinersClub Privilege 
- Regalia Gold 
- DinersClub Black Metal
- Infinia Metal
The Co-brand cards from HDFC are-
- Swiggy 
- Tata Neu
- Mariott Bonvoy 
- Indian Oil
- Indigo 6E
- IRCTC
And two more cards from HDFC within PayZapp that qualify as core cards for discounts are
- Pixel Play {split limit, not recommended unless first}
- Virtual RuPay
For self-employed or business people, these are also counted as core cards -
- Business Moneyback 
- Biz First
- Biz Grow
- Business Regalia
- BizPower
- BizBlack
There are a few older variants of cards which may or may not be discontinued for fresh applications.
- DinersClub Black (non metal, but many got LTF)
- Infinia (non metal - some users migrated already, but some are still having their old plastic infinia LTF. )
- TimesCard
What should be my first HDFC Card?
You should take one of the
core cards
from HDFC, as whatever co-brand card you take later, it will share the credit limit with your existing HDFC card.
If you take co-brand cards first, you may be able to apply for other co brand cards, and they will share the limit, but the bank would make it either super difficult for you to get a core card, or ask you to close existing co-brand cards before applying for a core card. We are recently seeing people getting freedom card from PayTM app even after holding co-brand cards, but then moving up the core card ladder may take some time and efforts.
The Pixel Play card is weird because it asks you to split your limit towards that card, and it's an irreversible reaction. (I have heard of people who got pixel play, not being able to tranfer back the limit to their OG core card even before/after closing pixel) (update- there seems to be an option to transfer a limit back, but I won't believe it till I see it)
Is my new card lifetime free?
If you apply from the website, you probably got the 'choose your card' page, and you were either shown the card you were looking for, or given a choice between three. In the bottom, in blue color ribbon, the card fees were mentioned, so take a screenshot of that while applying. If it says ""Life Time Free"", it means it IS free, and you won't be charged Joining fees or Annual/Renewal fees.
Alternatively, if you applied from from Swiggy or Tata Neu app, take screenshot of your LTF offer there.
Once you get the card, send a mail to customer care to confirm if the card issued to you is LTF. They will reply to you within a day mostly.
customerservices.cards[at]hdfcbank.com
First Year Free means that you WILL have to pay the Annual/Renewal fees for the card after the first year unless you meet the spend criteria. 
You can always email them and request for LTF conversion, but results may vary.
Is HDFC Swiggy Worth It?
YES
Absolutely, infact, it's better than Millenia especially with the rewards redemption fee.
I'll go ahead and say that it is worth it despite the fees if your usage aligns with it. If you get it LTF, go for it. Pounce on the offer/card
Why is Swiggy not LTF for me?
We don't know. You should just wait for a few months, you will get the LTF offer. Till then, you can get SBI Cashback and/or Airtel Axis and/or HSBC Live+
Which HDFC Card am I eligible for? Which cards can be offered via FD
A short while ago, this post was shared on the sub. It has the current eligibility criteria for the HDFC Card suite
https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/s/sZGbaKxl88
Refer to this above post to see the minimum limits, salary eligibility, government salary eligibility, ITR requirement and/or FD criteria (if available)
HDFC is not offering me Limit Increase/Enhancement
First check from your netbanking/app, and if you don't see an offer, Email their greviance redressal team. Usually HDFC rolls out LE offers between 20th-23rd of the month.
HDFC Card Upgrade
Same as above. Usually to move to DCBM or Infinia Metal is a tryst of its own, so tread with preparation. 
They may ask you to mail documents to their Chennai office, so you can either do this yourself or drop off documents at your nearest branch. They will mail it for you.
The other upgrades may be FYF Regalia Gold or FYF DCP from Millenia. These are also good, but choose according to use case.
One Line Review of the following cards from my side-
Core
Freedom
- Great to get your foot in the door for HDFC Core Cards ladder and get the sale discounts.
Moneyback
- Slightly better than freedom, still basic. Milestones easy to hit to get gift vouchers.
Millenia
- Good cashbacks but lower caps. Redemption fees are bad. Prefer Swiggy HDFC over this, keep this for core discounts offers. Again, good and easy to hit milestones and get gift vouchers.
DinersClub Millenia
- Same as Millenia, but on Diners Network. Poor acceptability.
DinersClub Privilege
- Great beginner card for lounge and movie benefits. Prefer if offered LTF over Millenia. Acceptance may be an issue. SmartBuy points make sense!
Regalia Gold
- Best beginner card for entering points and miles game. Amazing for lounge access. SmartBuy is super useful!{Atlas is better but costs twice and from a different bank}.
DinersClub Black Metal
- Almost Infinia. 9.9% on GCs, 16.6% on Flights, 33% on Hotels through SmartBuy. Unlimited Lounge and 6 Golf in a year! Some milestone benefits are good too. High annual fees.
Infinia Metal
- Apun ich bhagwaan hai.
Co Brand
Swiggy
- Great for those who didn't get SBI Cashback. Better than Millenia as cashback comes in statement directly.
Tata Neu Plus/Infinity
- Good ones. Infinity is better. Great for UPI if taken RuPay and spends in Tata ecosystem. Unconditional lounge access.
Mariott Bonvoy
- Great for Mariott Silver states, one night stay and lounge access.
Indian Oil
- good for fuel spends. RBL, SBI, Axis options should also be checked.
Indigo 6E
- weird as the rewards program is not yet integrated with the Blue Chip ecosystem. Still looks good to me. Check as per your use case.
IRCTC
- half decent. I've heard that there are too many cashback exclusions.
PayZapp
Pixel Play
- If you cannot get SBI Cashback, Millenia or Swiggy, then only look at this.
Virtual RuPay
- no. Unless you started with a co-brand card and desperately need a HDFC Core card for FK/AZ sales or instant discount offers.
Business Cards
BizFirst, BizGrow, Business Moneyback - Basic Starter cards. Good for instant discounts.
Business Regalia - Lounge was the only good perk, and even that has a spend criteria now. Won't recommend.
BizPower - This is good. But the rewards accelerator kicks in at 20k spends a month. Risky if you don't have fixed expenses. If you do, you can get good rewards! Great for tax payments.
BizBlack - Also great card. Especially alongside infinia. The reward rate is mind-blowing. Do note that this also has same issue as above, where you need X amount of spends for the rewards to kick in. The redemption is also through NetBanking.
FD Based Cards?
Core Cards up to Regalia Gold have options to be isused against FD.
Someone posted a screenshot of spreadsheet, I'll either link the post or screenshot here when I find it. It also contains eligibility criteria.

I have been trying to get a credit card for 5 months now. I have a savings account in hdfc which I started using as my salary account. Then started the never-ending calls and WhatsApp Messages from random employees of hdfc. In the beginning I would apply through them, provide them payslips, did KYC (during which they randomly visited my home twice without any prior information), yet my applications would always get declined. There was absolutely no communication from the bank's end as well, just a mail saying that my credit card application got declined as they have received prior applications from me which they were still processing. Any normal person would contact the customer care of the bank, or rather visit the bank itself, but me being the lazy bum I am, I decided to just give up.
Then came a promotional mail from ICICI Bank - in which they were offering ICICI Sapphiro Credit Card to alumnis of Tier 1/Premium Institutions of India. Generally I delete these mails, but out of desperation I filled out the form. The next day I received a call from a sales representative. I completed the KYC, uploaded my degree and voila! My card got approved in 2 days and received it the next day!
Credit limit: 300000 INR (cumulative)
Also received the Priority Pass Membership Card which offers 2 complimentary lounge accesses at select airports.
Anyway, thanks for reading this till here. And if you're new to the corporate world and waiting for your first credit card, don't lose hope! And if nothing works, maybe try getting into an IIT 😉

So here's the story.
I requested for closure of my Amazon Pay ICICI CC on 20th January, 2024. ICICI replied saying that the card has been closed on 21st January, 2024.
I kept that email with me and destroyed the card and moved on with life.
Jump to September 2024, I opted to take the Cibil yearly subscription just to see what the report contains and the benefits of it. Once, I saw the report,  I realized that my Amazon Pay CC is still active as per my CIBIL report.
Took this up with ICICI at all levels, but they just kept diverting from the issue and wouldn't even address the problem at hand. Typical bank behavior. Next step, complained to RBI Ombudsman. I read on this subreddit that we are entitled to a compensation of Rs. 500/- per day if the card is not closed beyond 7 days from request of closure.
RBI took 2 months to solve the issue. I tried to seek a compensation of 500 per day for over 200 days from Jan till September, but ICICI again said that the card is cancelled but they didn't update the same with Credit bureau. Finally, got compensated for this failure at 100 per day for 142 days. Since the rule kicks in only from April 26, 2024, so from that date till 13th September 2024.
Have a nice day. Feel free to shoot any questions.

we both added a guest on our priority pass and surprised the couple by giving the passes to them. For the third person I used my Amex platinum and they charged 2 rupees. I bought all of them in the priority line and let them in. They were so happy especially the husband and kept thanking us.

Thanks to the
r/creditcardsIndia
community for the motivation and advice! I redeemed two years' worth of Amex Platinum travel credit card Taj vouchers (₹20k total) plus Tata Neu points to enjoy a heavily discounted one-night stay at Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai, including a sea-view room and birthday perks. Sharing my strategy and experience for anyone looking to maximize credit card rewards for luxury stays.
---
First, a big thank you to this community for all the insights and motivation you’ve given me on my credit card journey. Your advice inspired me to explore and optimize my rewards better.
I recently redeemed a heavily discounted one-night stay at the iconic Taj Mahal Tower, Mumbai, and wanted to share my experience and how I achieved it.
How I did it:
Mainly through the Amex Platinum travel credit card. Over two years, I accumulated Taj vouchers worth ₹20,000 (₹10k each year), which are awarded after spending ₹4L within the membership year.
I also used two Tata Neu cards (Tata Neu Plus from HDFC and Tata Neu Infinity from SBI). These helped me accumulate about 4500 Neu points, which I redeemed during the stay.
My strategy:
I spent the ₹4L slowly in year 1 and quickly in year 2, thanks to insurance payments and travel bookings early in the second year. This gave me two overlapping Taj vouchers (one expiring Aug 2025, the other May 2026), which I combined for the stay.
I maximized daily shopping within the Tata ecosystem using Tata Neu cards, especially on Big Basket, which was my biggest source of Neu coins. The Tata Neu Infinity card gave me 7% cashback.
The stay:
It was near my birthday, and Taj made it special with a beautiful bouquet lasting over a week and Forest Essentials gift boxes worth ₹4k. Always use occasions like birthdays or anniversaries to get extra perks.
I booked the Taj Mahal Tower sea-view room (standard rates only, as Amex vouchers can’t be used on member rates even if you have Taj Epicure membership). Calling the reservation team to confirm voucher redemption is a must.
The sea-view room was worth the extra cost — stunning views of the Arabian Sea, Gateway of India, and Taj Mahal Palace domes from a lovely balcony on a higher floor.
Cost comparison for weekend stay (including breakfast & taxes):
Hotel
City View (₹)
Sea View (₹)
Taj Mahal Palace
29,500
35,400
Taj Mahal Tower
19,470
24,190
Instead of a Saturday check in & Sunday check out, we chose Sunday check-in and Monday check-out, which was about ₹2,000 cheaper.
Additional experiences:
Since the Taj Mahal Palace stay was too expensive, we enjoyed High Tea at the Sea Lounge restaurant there for about ₹3,200+tax per person. It included a buffet but no alcohol. I redeemed 4500 Tata Neu points and paid the rest with Tata Neu Infinity card, earning 5% points back.
A highlight was the free Taj Heritage tour, led by a staff member with 40+ years of service. It’s highly recommended and must be booked through the hotel staff as it fills up quickly.
Overall, this stay was a memorable experience combining smart credit card usage, loyalty points, and special occasion perks. I hope this helps others looking to maximize their credit card rewards for luxury stays!

CreditCardsIndia,https://old.reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1gyq4ln/avoid_credit_cards_till_absolutely_necessary/,1297,307,Avoid Credit Cards till absolutely necessary !!!,"Hi friends,
I am an ex-banker and currently practice as an Advocate in India. Most redditors come to this sub asking for advice on CCs, which one is good etc. Here are some stark truths which no Card Issuing bank or company will tell you:
A credit card is just like another loan
. It is a clean loan (that is there is no security like a house or car hypothecated to the issuer.
No card is good for anybody.  -
It is best to avoid a credit card till it becomes absolutely necessary because of frequent travel, stay at hotels etc.  If your company makes you take a CC ask them to get you a Corporate card, which they will settle on their own.
Card schemes are attractive-
All card issuers entice people using reward points and frequent offers on the card- these are temporary and can be withdrawn any time.
Payments to Card
-
PAY TOTAL AMOUNT DUE EVERY TIME
- If you carry forward by paying Minimum Amount Due (MAD), then the acronym sums it up- you are mad and getting trapped into revolving debt Every purchase you make gets added to the Total Amt due and interest @ 36 % p.a. and above is calculated on not only the earlier amount lying to your debit but also new amounts .
Credit SCORE. -
Dont go for a CC only to get your credit score - Say you want to buy a bike or car on loan at a later date, your loan approving bank will waive CIBIL score requirement (if there is none against your PAN upon search). Once you pay the EMIs on time, your CIBIL score will automatically go up.
Monitor your SMS/ Card statements
and dispute any txn which is not yours. Onus is on you to dispute. one of my previous bank's customers diligently saw debits for medical insurance to his credit card and when the bank failed to address this issue, he sued and got Rs. 5 lacs in compensation !
Dont go for BNPL or conversion of purchases into EMIs on CC
- all these are traps - nothing comes free. If you have cash, buy the product, else forget about it. If you want iphone, do with Nothing 2A - ultimately  you are the master of your cash flows. If you cant buy Nothing 2A, go for a dumb phone and buy smartphone later. !!
Read
Most Important Terms and Conditions (MITC)
sent to you periodically or go to the card website and read their T&Cs carefully
If you dont want a card-
refuse it in first instance. If they send you a card still, keep monitoring the SoA -
charges debited like annual charges etc. add up fast- if you are not keeping a hawk's eye then it is your problem !
If you fall into a problem of repayment
, DONT borrow another loan to repay the CC outstanding. beg from family or friends and pay off FULLY and get the damn card CLOSED not SETTLED.
Friends, I have been in this business for close to 30 years as a Banker, now as an advocate and have handled close to 2200 odd cases as an arbitrator. To all young redditors, this is the soundest advice I can give.
Also remember the old American Saying ""There is nothing called a free lunch"".
Cheers !",

I wanted to share my recent experience with
HDFC Bank's misleading credit card sales tactics
and how I got
₹10,000 in compensation
after filing a complaint with the
RBI Ombudsman
. If you've faced similar issues, this might help you take action!
What Happened?
I applied for an
HDFC Tata Neu Infinity Credit Card
through a sales representative.
Instead, they
issued an IOCL Credit Card without my consent
.
When I raised the issue, their sales team and manager
misled me into reapplying multiple times
,
assuring me of approval
despite knowing my application would be rejected.
Every rejection caused
multiple hard inquiries on my credit report
, affecting my credit score.
How I Took Action
Raised multiple complaints with
HDFC Bank
When they
failed to resolve the issue
, I filed a complaint on the
RBI CMS portal
RBI
investigated the case
, found HDFC at fault for
not informing me of the rejection reason
, and directed them to compensate me.
The Outcome
RBI ordered
HDFC to credit ₹10,000 as compensation
for their deficiency in service.
The amount was credited to my account on
March 13, 2025
.
Here’s the
official response from RBI
along with a
screenshot of the credited amount
(attached).

Never let banks manipulate you into reapplying without clear reasons.
If anyone else has faced
credit card mis-selling
or
unethical banking practices
, I highly recommend filing a complaint via the
RBI CMS portal
.
Would love to hear your thoughts - has anyone else successfully taken action against such practices?

Filed a complaint with the CP Grams portal.
In July 2024, I requested closure of my ICICI credit card ending in 2009. They said it was closed. But for 8+ months, the account showed as active on my credit report.
Turns out, ICICI clubbed 3 credit cards under one account (which I was never explicitly told), and used that as a technical excuse to keep the whole account active. Even after I closed one card, they kept the account running, citing a ₹0.55 excess balance that they never told me about until March 2025. I had a coral card which I closed in July 2024 and Rubyx dual variant LTF cards that I closed in November 2024. ICICI claims that when I closed the coral card, I should've also closed the other cards for my account to close. Some stupid shit they pull out in name of technicalities.
Under RBI rules, failure to close a credit card within 7 days entitles the customer to ₹500/day compensation. Non-reporting to credit bureaus is ₹100/day, and this case involves both.
I raised a complaint with the RBI Ombudsman in April 2025. That’s when ICICI started scrambling:
First, they quietly offered ₹9,600 as compensation.
Then in their official RBI response, they changed it to ₹12,300.
And finally, without my consent, and while the case is still pending, they credited ₹25,900 to my account on May 30, 2025.
I’ve categorically rejected this amount in writing to both ICICI and the RBI Ombudsman. I’ve asked for the ₹500/day compensation (₹1,16,500) as per RBI guidelines, and I’m not even claiming the ₹100/day part out of goodwill.
If ICICI refuses, I’m ready to take this to court. I’ve submitted all proofs to the RBI.
Is there anything more I can do?",

Never thought I'd pull this off!,"I have been very thankful to the golden era of Axis Magnus when we got 25,000 edge rewards for 1 lakh spends a month. Last year, I took my family of 5 to Europe and saved about 6 lakhs on hotel stays.
And now, while I never imagined I’d be able to fly business class from the US to India for free, but here we are.
When I first started getting excited about travel in my late 20s, this kind of thing felt far off. I’d always hoped to fly business one day on international long-hauls, but getting a $4,000+ ticket without paying for it wasn’t something I thought I could pull off.
Recently took the United nonstop flight from Newark EWR to Delhi DEL. I used 100k United miles + $10 in taxes. These were miles I had transferred a couple of years ago from Magnus. I had stacked up a bunch of points back then and moved a good chunk to United and as many to Accor.
A couple of years ago, those same United miles helped me book a one-way ticket for my wife for just 50k miles and made it way easier for her to come with me on a US work trip where the return leg was crazy expensive.
Funny thing: when I searched for this flight, it initially showed 230k miles. But when I accidentally clicked it on the United desktop site, it dropped to 100k. This weird pricing glitch only shows up on the website, not the app and apparently this happens with a lot of fares. Felt lucky and just booked it, even before my work trip was finalised.
One of the best things about United is how flexible they are with miles. You can cancel till the very end and get all your points and taxes back. No questions. Super easy to change dates too. Honestly, their miles program and app deserves its own post.
This was my first international business class flight. And yeah, going back to economy is going to be hard, especially for flights longer than 8 hours. Got real sleep, had great food three to four times, pajamas, slippers, even had someone come and take my coat at takeoff which felt wild. The peace and quiet of the business class cabin is something else!
And the United sundae cart: I get why people love it so much now.
At the time of my booking this was selling for about $3800 one way. Would I pay full price for this? Probably not. But I’m really grateful that credit cards and points make things like this possible. And also really thankful for this community - so many of you have helped me figure things out along the way.
Hope we all get to do more of these.","['https://preview.redd.it/rkxmjs2cl26f1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=524fa6f91a9c31c6db6fb250491098fc4178f2cf', 'https://preview.redd.it/9mk8pq2cl26f1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=075b5f3c8e7adfd29464966d60dac6f5c1602099', 'https://preview.redd.it/avimlr2cl26f1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=92628f405ba3dd6cc58697f3e3ff729605a725d8', 'https://preview.redd.it/nkwdss2cl26f1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=849c7f954286395d49129750448472e3dc550179', 'https://preview.redd.it/foubcu2cl26f1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=f60e334e3719b6d86b24c71b29c6724a085a42d5', 'https://preview.redd.it/m9v7lu2cl26f1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=73efc46a5da1abf02755c11541ac1fd10b05843a', 'https://preview.redd.it/yeyd8s2cl26f1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=c92e996b3827bf9641a021721feb6b8d6f4d0df1', 'https://preview.redd.it/oo14v43cl26f1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=66315a635a3bded45c03702b7082bc72427de120', 'https://preview.redd.it/0ev0163cl26f1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=357d9100094460ad0063508d713c7f5fd6279276', 'https://preview.redd.it/54d4c33cl26f1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=749abcd49bf21665016424ff03314a7ae8b49921']"
